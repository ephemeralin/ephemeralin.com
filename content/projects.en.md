I like trying different programming languages, frameworks and technologies, so during my professional life I created a bunch of pet-projects. Some of them are presented here.

* **Tincture**: service which is aggregating different news feeds in one place. It is built for those who are annoyed by ads, subscriptions, "fat" web-sites, "smart" recommendations and infinite browsing between all that stuff. There are actually several parts, which can be easily deployed to the AWS: [backend API](https://github.com/ephemeralin/tincture-api-2), [frontend](https://github.com/ephemeralin/tincture), [parser](https://github.com/ephemeralin/tincture-parser).
* **Jira Groups Renamer**: SQL script which allows you to rename bunch of Jira groups in one transaction. Lack of the regular feature if group renaming is a real pain for a Jira administrator.
* **360Ëš**: Web application for collecting, analysis and comparing news from different sources. [Sources](https://github.com/ephemeralin/_360).
* **MyStem Simple Wrapper**: wrapper library for [Yandex MyStem](https://tech.yandex.ru/mystem/) binary util. Code is [here](https://github.com/ephemeralin/mystem-simple-wrapper).
* and others ðŸ˜‰
